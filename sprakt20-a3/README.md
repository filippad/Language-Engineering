### Task 1

###### What similarity metrics can you use in your algorithm? Which one would you prefer to use? Why?

Other similarity metrics could be used are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance

###### Increasing  left and right windows to 10:
By increasing number of left and right windows to 10, the results seem to be more accurate.

###### Make number of left and right asymmetric:
Got similar results as previous but the order is slightly different.

###### Decreasing the number of dimensionality to 10 with 8 non-zero elements:
When decreasing the number of dimensionality to 10 with 8 non-zero elements, the results seem less accurate
